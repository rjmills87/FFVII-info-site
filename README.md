# Final Fantasy VII Remake Info Page

## Overview

This project is a basic web application that I built to begin getting familiar with building using React and Tailwind CSS.
I decided to build an information page about the remake of my favourite childhood videogame, Final Fantasy VII which was released on the original Playstation in 1997.

## FEATURES

- Page has been optimised for various display sizes Desktop, Tablets, Smartphones.

- Character Profile Section: The CharactersBanner component enhances user interaction within the project. Using Reacts useState hook, it is easy for users to explore the diverse characters from Final Fantasy VII. The Characters component uses a grid layout, allowing users to browse through character thumbnails. Once a character is selected, the CharacterProfile component dynamically updates to display detailed information, including profile images and descriptions.

- Screenshots Section: The ScreenshotsBanner Component allows users to navigate through a collection of in-game screenshots using Reacts useState and useEffect hooks. The Carousel component also incorporates accessibility best practices, ensuring that all interactive elements are properly labeled. This component offers users a seamless transition between images using either mouse click event or left or right arrow keys.
