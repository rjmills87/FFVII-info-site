# Final Fantasy VII Remake Info Site

## Overview

This was a simple project that I built using the Vite framework so I could start putting into practice building web applications with React and Tailwind CSS. I decided to build a single page info site about the recent remake of my favourite video game as a young kid, Final Fantasy VII. I mainly took design inspirations from the offical Square-Enix website who are the developers of the game.

#### LIVE LINK :

## FEATURES

- Page has been optimized for various display sizes Desktop, Tablets, Smartphones.

- Specific layouts were created for different devices so images would scale correctly

- Character select has been implemented using React useState hook

- Screenshot carousel can be used by either clicking on the on-screen buttons or has Arrow key functionality which was implemented by using Reacts useEffect hook.

## Tech Used

Within Vite I used React with Vanilla JavaScript and chose to style the site using Tailwind CSS
